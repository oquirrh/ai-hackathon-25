Here are the key improvements made using DSPy:

Structured Prediction: Instead of using raw prompts, we've defined structured predictors using DSPy's Signature classes:

ServiceIdentifier for AWS service identification
TerraformGenerator for configuration generation
FileAnalyzer for project structure analysis


Few-Shot Learning: The code now includes a bootstrapping mechanism that can learn from examples, making predictions more reliable.
Modular Design: Each step of the process is now a separate DSPy module that can be:

Trained independently
Evaluated separately
Improved with additional examples


Better Error Handling: The DSPy framework provides better error handling and validation of outputs.
Type Hints: Added proper typing for better code maintainability.

To use this improved version:

Install DSPy and other requirements:

bashCopypip install dspy-ai python-dotenv

Set up your environment variables:

bash

OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here

Run the script:

bashCopypython terraform_expert.py
Would you like me to explain any particular part in more detail or make additional improvements to specific components?



More Reliable LLM Interactions:

The original code made direct API calls with raw prompts, which can be inconsistent
DSPy provides structured prediction and few-shot learning, making the outputs more reliable and consistent
It can learn from examples to improve its performance over time


Better Architecture:

Original code had mixed responsibilities and duplicated logic across files
New version has clear separation of concerns with distinct modules for each task
More maintainable and easier to test


Improved Error Handling:

Original code had basic try/except blocks
DSPy provides better validation and error handling of LLM outputs
More robust when dealing with unexpected inputs or outputs


Easier to Extend:

Want to add new capabilities? Just create a new DSPy Signature
Want to improve performance? Add more examples to the bootstrapping
Want to change models? Just update the config


Cost Efficient:

Original made multiple separate API calls
DSPy can optimize the number of calls and token usage
Better caching and reuse of results


Better Development Experience:

Type hints make it easier to understand the code
Structured modules are easier to test
Clear interfaces between components



So yes, while the original code worked, this DSPy version is more production-ready and maintainable. It's the difference between a prototype and a robust system.
Would you like me to demonstrate how to add any specific improvements, like additional examples for training or new capabilities?
